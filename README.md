# F1_Project
My first personal project on F1 2022 season data

8 weeks ago I didn’t know how to write a single line of code. 

I was keen to learn more after being exposed to the world of data analysis and data visualisation at work 

I started to learn the basics with SoloLearn, and moved to DataCamp for more whilst completing LinkedIn Learning courses.

The pros recommend to practise what you learn with personal projects that interest you. 

I decided to have a play around with some Formula 1 data as my first project and I’m pretty pleased with the outcome. 

I've become pretty familiar with writing basic queries using select statement, aggregate functions and manipulating tables.  

You'll find a selection of queries used to answer questions I wanted to solve from the data. 

Datasource: Kaggle
Tools: MySQL Workbench
Data visualisation: Tableau
